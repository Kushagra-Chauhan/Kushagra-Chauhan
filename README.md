- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kushagra-Chauhan
- Currently I am a sophomore at IIIT Surat.
- The fact that it's the people like us who are leading the world towards future, with that in mind I decided to plunge into the tech world. 
- So far in this quest I got familiar with languages like HTML, CCS, JavaScript, Python and C.
- I keep looking for something new and always open for collabrating in exciting and cool projects.
- One can catch up with me at Instagram [@kushagra1_unb](https://www.instagram.com/kushagra1_unb/), Twitter [@kushagra1_unb](https://twitter.com/kushagra1_unb)
